# PickARestaurant

## An introduction

This is an Android application written in Kotlin that picks a random restaurant within 1.5km radius of the user's location

### Purpose

I want to learn about making an Android application using Kotlin and the REST API architecture through communicating between the application and Google's Places API. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to have the application decide a random restaurant for me.
- As a user, I want to be able to be directed to view the restaurant listing on Google Maps application.
- As a user, I want to have an option to have the application pick another restaurant again.
